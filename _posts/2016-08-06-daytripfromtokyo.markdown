Many tourists want to go on a day trip from Tokyo but do not know where to go. Here are my recommendations. Each city has a unique character for you to enjoy.

|No.|City/Sites|What to do / What to see|From Tokyo St.(Train)|From Shinjuku St.(Train)|
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
|1|Kawasaki|Doraemon Musium (Fujiko. F Fujio Musium), Lazona Kawasaki(Shopping Mall), Kawasaki Daishi (Temple)|0:25|0:39|
|2|Yokohama|Yokohama Chinatown, Sankeien Garden, Landmark tower, Yokohama Seabass(Tour Boat and Cruise)|0:27|0:29|
