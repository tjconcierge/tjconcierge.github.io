We are happy to announce that we've started the official web site for our community.

Firstly, we started the community in London with the [group in meetup.com][meetup-london] in October 2015. Secondly, we organized an event in San Francisco with the [group in meetup.com][meetup-sf] in June 2016.

As of today, we have 2 communities. We hope to have more communities all over the world!

Founder of Travel to Japan Concierge, Taka
