We are happy to announce that we've started the official web site for our community.

Firstly, we started the community in London with the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Travel-to-Japan-Concierge-in-London/" target="_blank">group in meetup.com(London)</a> in October 2015. Secondly, we organized an event in San Francisco with the
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Travel-to-Japan-Concierge-in-San-Francisco/" target="_blank">group in meetup.com(SF)</a> in June 2016.

As of today, we have 2 communities. We hope to have more communities all over the world!

Founder of Travel to Japan Concierge, Taka
